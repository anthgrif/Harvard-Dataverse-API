# Images of Completed Harvard Dataverse API

## Home Page - home:index.png

You may navigate to the following page with the link http://harvard-dataverse-api.herokuapp.com/ or https://harvard-dataverse-api.herokuapp.com/index

This page is meant to welcome the user to the web API and encourage the user to navigate to the "Search" page.

The user may query the Elasticsearch index with the documents from the attached JSON file. The user may either query with an "id" or the user's own specified "field" and "value". The returned documents from the queries are presented in a Bootstrap Accordion with each document able to switch from being collapsed or showing its contents.

If you would like a break from querying, I have included this game which involved a mix of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I made it as part of the curriculum for a course I took a few months ago. I also included as a test to see how well I could integrate old projects with a new web interface.

The following error messages will pop up if you try navigating to a page that does not exist. 

## All (for debugging) - all.png

You may navigate to the following page with the link http://harvard-dataverse-api.herokuapp.com/all

I primarily used this page as a method of debugging to determine if the documents were being properly saved and indexed into Elasticsearch.
